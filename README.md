# Petri-Nets-analysis-for-industrial-automation-applications

## Introduction and Purpose

This is my first project with python. I tried here to test different competences learnt during my Software engineering bachelor at Politecnico di Milano and also to face a real and challenging problem with a mathematical approach. 
I used some basic knowledge from Linear Algebra, Algorithms & Data structure and Industrial automation courses. 

## A bit of theory

Petri's nets is a really fascinating instrument used in different fields: many of the programmable logic controllers (or PLC) available on the market share some concepts with the PetriNets-point of view; the nets theirselves are a great instrument to study different properties of automatic systems. 
Livelock, Deadlock, Reversibility and Limitedness of tokens are only some of the properties that we can study, if we choose Petri's Net modeling. 

## The Code

I thought it could be really interesting to create a program that gets in input a matrix which describes the modeled system and preoceeds with a fast analysis of different properties. 
Different analysis performed (still work in progress) are: 
- Is the net a FSM? Is a marked graph?
- T-invariants and reversibility
- P-invariants and boundedness (still in progress)
- Marking tree exploration for liveness(still in progress)
